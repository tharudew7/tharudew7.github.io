Though we had a really tough day first, we had the same enthusiasm to go for the next practice too knowing that our instructor is too strict, but it was like going to school on a day you have an exam. So, days passed and it was our 2nd  day of our training. Like normally on the 2nd   day of driving, a student must be able to drive atleast straight on the road.

          <h3>Water Color Painting</h3>
          <p>Watercolor or watercolour, also aquarelle, is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-based solution. Watercolor refers to both the medium and the resulting artwork.</p>

          <h3>Oil Painting</h3>
          <p>Oil paints blend well with each other, making subtle variations of color possible as well as creating many details of light and shadow. Oil paints can be diluted with turpentine or other thinning agents, which artists take advantage to paint in layers.</p>
